***********
Tips: Please do not skip the opening phase of match, or there may be some problems in combos.
===========================================================
This is a poker-playing character. It's based on Jinny's Rozwel, but not a spriteswap.
Its basic movements are similar to Rozwel and Oswald, using playing cards like knives in fighting.
The combat system of this character is quite like the BC system in KOF 2002 Unlimited Match.
When the AI level is no lower than 5, this char will be much stronger than usual.
AI5: Could cancel her movements unconditionally. Add a move which could reverse the attacks.
AI6: Could do these at the same time.
===========================================================
Character background：
On the surface, Rose Willina is a tavern-lady who has no brother and sister. In fact, she is a member of underworld organization, in charge of providing intelligence.
She has a cooperation relationship with Rozwel and Oswald. It seems like that they treat her as a complete intelligence agent and know nothing about her strength, or maybe they just pretend to know nothing.
Rose is a backstabber. She is decisive, sometimes even cold. No one knows why she can use playing cards to fight, just like Rozwel and Oswald. Will the story behind her fighting style bring her some troubles? Only God knows.
